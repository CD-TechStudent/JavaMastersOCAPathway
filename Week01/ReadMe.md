# Java Masters Week01

## In Class

## Objectives

1. In this lab students will practice writing and using constructors
2. After this lab students should be able to produce enumerated types.
3. This lab introduces the practice of writing unit tests for code being developed.


## Overview

This lab introduces constructors and enumerated types.

## Unit Test

You are expected to write unit tests for the `getColor` method in this lab. Be sure to test that it returns the same color that was set in the constructor.

Remember to use Test Driven Development: create stubs of your methods and write your tests first, confirm that they run fail the tests, then implement your methods so that they pass the tests.

## Instructions

For this lab, goto a java file called `MainPart1.java`

### Part one = new MainPart1();

1. In `week01.inclass.part1` package create two classes, `BoringThing` and `ColorfulThing`
2. Create a constructor for `ColorfulThing` that takes one String as a parameter and stores it as an instance variable.
3. Provide a `getColor` method for `ColorfulThing`
4. Go to the `MainPart1` class and add a `main` method.
5. In `main` declare and instantiate five `BoringThing`s and five `ColorfulThing`s (pick any colors you like).
6. Print out each `ColorfulThing`'s color.
7. Try creating another `ColorfulThing` using a default (no-argument) constructor. Notice that this causes an error.

### public enum Part {II;}

Letting a user specify any string and blindly assuming it's a color is a bit na√Øve. Let's specify what colors of `ColorfulThing`s are available.

1. Add an enumerated type called `Color` to `ColorfulThing` and give it at least three options
2. Refactor the `ColorfulThing` constructor and class to use the new enumerated type. Don't forget to refactor the getter you created earlier.
3. Adjust your `main` method to use the new enumerated type as well.
4. Run your program to make sure the new enumerated type works.

# In Class part 2

## Objectives

1. In this lab students will practice overloading constructors and initializing objects based on constructor arguments.
2. After this lab students should be comfortable manipulating instance variables in constructors and other object methods.

## Overview

This lab focuses on initializing objects using constructors and overloading constructors. It also introduces the use of arrays as arguments and instance variables.

## Unit Test

You are expected to write unit tests for your code in this lab. Be sure to test the behavior of `ThingContainer` in multiple scenarios, including testing the `add` method when the `ThingContainer is or is not full. You are responsible for determining which other methods need to be tested and how to test them. Remember to practice Test Driven Development as you work on this lab.

## Instructions

For this lab, use the java file called `MainPart2.Java`. Import your `ColorfulThing` definition from the last lab.

### Part one

Create a new class called `ThingContainer`; this will be a class designed to hold multiple `ColorfulThing`s.

Give the `ThingContainer` class an array of `ColorfulThing`s and a constructor that takes one argument: an integer that defines the size of the array.

`ThingContainer` needs an `add` method to add `ColorfulThing`s to its array. It should add the `ColorfulThing`s in the order they are received. If the array is full when `add` is called then it should print the error message "ThingContainer is full"

`ThingContainer` should also be able to print all of the `ColorfulThing`s it has. Add a printThings method for this.

Create a `main` method for InitializationLab2. In this method create at least three `ThingContainers` and test that you can fill them with randomly generated `ColorfulThing`s and that you get the error message described above.

### Part 2: Too many things

Let's enhance our `ThingContainer`. Start by adding a method to remove items. We'll call our method `pop`, and it should remove the last element in the array of things and return that element.

What if we don't want the last element in the array? Let's add a `remove` method, and overload it to handle two different cases. Here they are:

1. We call the `remove` method with a `Color` value from the enumerated type in `ColorfulThing`. Remove the first element of that color from the array and return it. Return `null` if the `ThingContainer` does not contain a `ColorfulThing` of that color.
2. We call the `remove` method with a `ColorfulThing` object. Remove the `ColorfulThing` that matches that object and return it; if it is not in the array return `null`.

Be sure to adjust the elements in the array after each removal so that it stays in order (the next item added should always be added to the end).

Demonstrate the use of all of these new methods in your `main` method.

### Part 3:

Add another constructor to `ThingContainer` that can take an array of `ColorfulThings` as its argument. This constructor should initialize its array to match the contents of the array argument.

Modify your `main` method to test that this new constructor works.
